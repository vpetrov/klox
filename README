klox is written in Kotlin. This repo contains a Kotlin Multiplatform project with modules that can build:

* klox, the command line program
* klox server, a backend server that serves the klox playground
* klox js playground, a React page that runs klox in javascript and outputs the AST

Use IntelliJ to open and run projects from each chapter.
